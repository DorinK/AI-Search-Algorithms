# AI-Search-Algorithms
First Assignment in 'Artificial Intelligence' course by Dr. Ram Meshulam at Bar-Ilan University

**Implementation of a search engine that supports a number of search algorithms to solve the given problem.**  
<ins>Supported search algorithms:</ins>
* IDS
* UCS
* A*
* IDA*

**Input:** The program will read all of its input from a single input.txt file. The first line of the file will determine which algorithm to use.

**Output:** The output will be written to the output.txt file.  
It will contain one line in the following format:
the path <Space<Space>> The number of vertices developed (removed from the open list) <Space<Space>> The cost of the path by the algorithm specified in the input.  
If no path is found, "no path" (without any addition) will be written in the output.txt file.

The solution route is described by the series of actions required to cross the route.
